#  Problem Statement:-
# Generate a random integer from a to b.
#  You and your friend have to guess a number between two numbers, a and b.
#  a and b are inputs taken from the user. Your friend is player 1 and plays first.
#  He will have to keep choosing the number, and 
# your program must tell whether the number is greater than the actual number or less than
#  the actual number. Log the number of trials it took your friend to arrive at the number. 
# You play the same game, and then the person with the minimum number of trials wins! 
# Randomly generate a number after taking a and b as input and donâ€™t show that to the user.

import random #to get random number
a = int(input("Enter value of a: "))
b = int(input("Enter value of b: "))

player1 = input("Enter name of Player 1: ")
player2 = input("Enter name of Player 2: ")

        print(f"You have {6-i} trials left.")

        if player == random_num:
            print(f"{player_name} You Guess right..!")
            print(f"{player_name} guessed in {i} guesses.")
            break
        elif player < random_num:
            print(f"Your guess is smaller than the number\nTry again")
